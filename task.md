names, start date (format YYYY-MM-DD) and email
4. Employee data can be changed by clicking on Edit

6. Users can logout from the application

## What needs to be done:
* Prepare test cases for this application using any tool of your choice.
* Please use any language or framework (preferably Selenium) of your preference to
automate a selection of the use cases.
* Please add clear documentation with respect to your test approach, framework
choice, com.mobiquity.test.tests covered, test results.
* Explain clearly how to launch the automated com.mobiquity.test.tests. Add the documentation to the
same repository as the other files. Preferably upload everything to Bitbucket or
Github or any code repository of your choice. If that is not possible, please send
all files in a zip-file.
